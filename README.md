# Turtlebot3_MazeSolver
This is a ROS + Gazebo project using a Turtlebot3 with LIDAR to autonomously solve a maze using the wall-follower algorithm. 
The mazes are custom-made in Gazebo and the LIDAR sensor reads distance to the walls in all directions. Below is a video demonstrating the
robot solving varying mazes.
